A CLI — and the protocol knowledge base behind it — for writing **AngryMiao
CyberBoard R4** configuration **without the official AM Master app**.

The goal: manage your keymap and LED display as **separate, version-controllable
sources**, and write them straight to the board from the command line — robustly,
without AM Master's flaky connection.

> **Status:** the write protocol is fully reverse-engineered, and the `cyberboard`
> CLI is implemented and published (see **Install** below). Writing and keymap
> read-back are **verified on real R4 hardware**; keymap authoring (TOML) and LED
> display authoring (GIF / declarative recipes) work today, and the MCP server and
> Claude Code plugin ship alongside the CLI. Still WIP: per-key LED authoring. The
> self-contained protocol spec lives under [`.claude/rules/`](.claude/rules/) (Japanese).

## Install

**Prerequisite:** Python ≥ 3.11. Every method below installs the same package
([`cyberboard-cli` on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cyberboard-cli/)) — they
differ only in *how* it lands on your machine.

### Which installer should I pick?

| If you want… | Use | You get |
|---|---|---|
| macOS, simplest, shell completion wired for you | **Homebrew** | core + LED + keymap edit (TUI) |
| One isolated global command, any OS | **uv tool** or **pipx** | core + whatever extras you ask for |
| It inside a project / existing venv | **pip** | core + extras |
| To try it once without installing | **uvx** | ephemeral, extras on the fly |

### Pick your extras

The package is a small core plus opt-in extras, so a device-only or keymap-only
setup stays lean. Add them in brackets, e.g. `'cyberboard-cli[led,verify]'`:

| Extra | Pulls in | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| *(core)* | `pyserial` | device I/O + keymap build — `devices` / `read` / `write` / `doctor` / `build` |
| `[led]` | `pillow` | LED authoring — `led` / `anim` / `compose` |
| `[tui]` | `textual` | the interactive keymap editor — `keymap edit` |
| `[verify]` | `jsonschema` | strict schema checks in `verify` (degrades to basic checks without it) |
| `[mcp]` | `mcp` | the `cyberboard-mcp` server — see [MCP server](#mcp-server) |
| `[all]` | all of the above | everything |

### Commands

```sh
# Homebrew (macOS) — full app (device I/O + LED + keymap edit), completion auto-wired:
brew install GeneralD/tap/cyberboard-cli

# uv tool — isolated global command (recommended for the full feature set):
uv tool install cyberboard-cli                 # core only
uv tool install 'cyberboard-cli[led]'          # + LED authoring

# pipx — isolated global command:
pipx install 'cyberboard-cli[led]'

# pip — into the currently-active venv:
pip install 'cyberboard-cli[led]'

# uvx — run once, nothing installed:
uvx --from 'cyberboard-cli[led]' cyberboard --help
```

> **Homebrew bundles the full app** — device I/O, LED authoring (`anim` / `led`
> / `compose`), and the keymap editor (`keymap edit`). `pillow` ships as a
> prebuilt wheel and `textual` is pure Python, so installs stay quick (~30 s, not
> a long source build). Only the `[verify]` and `[mcp]` extras aren't bundled
> (both degrade gracefully). If you want them, install a separate
> `uv tool install 'cyberboard-cli[all]'` — use `[all]` (not just
> `[verify,mcp]`) so that environment can also render LED when it runs the MCP
> server.

**Developing on a clone?** Run it straight from the source tree, no install:

```sh
uv run --extra led cyberboard --help   # device commands don't need --extra led
```

## Usage

`cyberboard <command>` — run `cyberboard <command> --help` for each command's options.

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `devices` / `device` | List connected boards / show one device's detail |
| `doctor` | Non-destructive connectivity health check |
| `build` | `keymap.toml` → IR config (`--dump` for the reverse) |
| `verify` | Validate an IR config against the schema |
| `led` | GIF ⇄ IR display codec + terminal player (`gif2ir` / `ir2gif` / `play` / `recipe`) |
| `anim` | Render declarative LED animations (`render` / `preview` / `montage`) |
| `compose` | Compose a `led.toml` manifest (multi-source slots) → IR |
| `read` | Read config back from the device (`keymap`) |
| `keymap` | Keyboard-shaped keymap grid, colored by key category with compact ⌘⌥⌃⇧ / arrow symbols — `show` (ASCII, color on a TTY), or `edit` (interactive TUI, click a key to reassign; needs `[tui]`) |
| `write` | Write an IR config to the device |
| `set-time` | Set the device RTC clock |
| `store` | Where per-device configs are saved (`path` shows the resolved root; `--selftest`) |
| `get` | Show the current config in the terminal — live keymap grid (per layer) + stored LED frame counts, labelled by provenance (`--layer N` / `--all-layers`) |
| `dump` | Dump the current config to a file/stdout — hybrid: live keymap + stored LED, each labelled by provenance (`-o FILE`) |
| `diff` | Diff two configs (snapshot refs or files): per-position keymap + per-slot LED frame counts (`diff <a> <b>`) |
| `history` | List a device's saved snapshots (newest first) with size + provenance — the refs `diff` / `restore` accept |
| `restore` | Re-write a past snapshot to the device — undo/rollback (`restore <ref>`, `<ref>` = `latest` or a timestamp; dry-run unless `--execute`) |
| `completion` | Print a shell completion script (`bash` / `zsh` / `fish`) |

```sh
cyberboard devices                                              # find your board
cyberboard anim preview -r examples/led/text-scroll.json -o preview.gif   # author an LED animation
cyberboard led play -i preview.gif                              # play it right in the terminal (Ctrl-C to stop)
cyberboard compose -m examples/led/compose.toml -b base.json -o config.json   # combine many sources per slot
cyberboard build -k keymap.toml -b base.json -o config.json     # build a config from a TOML keymap
cyberboard keymap show config.json --layer 1                    # view the keymap (colored grid; --color auto/always/never)
cyberboard keymap edit config.json                              # edit it interactively — click a key to reassign (needs [tui])
cyberboard write config.json --execute                          # write it (omit --execute for a dry run)
```

### Shell completion

`cyberboard completion <shell>` prints a completion script. Homebrew wires this
up automatically; for a pip/uv install, install it manually:

```sh
cyberboard completion zsh  > "${fpath[1]}/_cyberboard"            # zsh (then restart)
cyberboard completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/cyberboard   # bash
cyberboard completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/cyberboard.fish    # fish
```

## MCP server

Every CLI operation is also exposed to MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code,
editors, AI agents) through a small **stdio** server that simply wraps the CLI —
so the MCP tool surface never drifts from the CLI's behaviour.

**1. Install with the `[mcp]` extra** so the `cyberboard-mcp` command is on your
`PATH` (add `[led]` too if you want the LED tools to render inside the server):

```sh
uv tool install 'cyberboard-cli[mcp]'        # or: pipx install / pip install
uv tool install 'cyberboard-cli[mcp,led]'    # + LED tools (render/preview/gif)
cyberboard-mcp                               # quick check: serves over stdio (Ctrl-C to quit)
```

**2. Register it with your client** — the command must be on the client's `PATH`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "cyberboard": { "command": "cyberboard-mcp" } } }
```

Per client:

- **Claude Code** — just use the [plugin](#claude-code-plugin) below; it wires
  the server for you, no JSON editing.
- **Claude Desktop / Cursor / editors** — paste the JSON above into the client's
  MCP config. If it can't find the command, give an absolute path
  (`which cyberboard-mcp`) or run it through uvx (no separate install needed):

  ```json
  { "mcpServers": { "cyberboard": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "cyberboard-cli[mcp]", "cyberboard-mcp"] } } }
  ```

- **[mcpm](https://mcpm.sh) users** — register it once and add it to a profile:

  ```sh
  mcpm new cyberboard --type stdio --command uvx \
    --args "--from cyberboard-cli[mcp] cyberboard-mcp"
  mcpm profile edit base --add-server cyberboard
  ```

**Tools (11):** `list_devices` · `device_info` · `doctor` · `verify` ·
`build_keymap` · `render_animation` · `preview_animation` · `gif_to_ir` ·
`ir_to_gif` · `read_keymap` · `write_config`.

> `write_config` is destructive and defaults to a **dry run** — pass
> `execute=true` to actually write to the board. The LED tools
> (`render_animation` / `preview_animation` / `gif_to_ir` / `ir_to_gif`) need the
> `[led]` extra in the same environment.

## Claude Code plugin

For [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), the plugin auto-configures the
`cyberboard` MCP server — no hand-editing of `mcpServers`, and **no separate
package install needed**.

**Inside Claude Code** (these are slash commands, not shell), add this repo as a
plugin marketplace and install the plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add GeneralD/cyberboard-cli
/plugin install cyberboard@cyberboard-cli
```

Enabling it starts the server automatically. The MCP entry **self-bootstraps**
via `uvx --from 'cyberboard-cli[mcp,led]' cyberboard-mcp` — uvx fetches the
package on first launch (LED tools included, pillow from a wheel — no source
build) and caches it thereafter.

> **Prerequisite:** [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for `uvx`). Nothing else
> to install — the plugin pulls the server itself. The plugin manifest lives at
> `plugins/cyberboard/` and the marketplace manifest at
> `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (both in this repo).

## Why

The official setup has three problems this project fixes:

- **Keymap and LED live in one JSON file.** Applying a community LED animation
  overwrites your keymap. This project keeps them apart and recombines them only
  at build time, so "swap just the LED" is safe.
- **AM Master's connection is flaky** — writes succeed or fail at random. The
  root causes are now identified (see the protocol doc) and are fixable on the
  CLI side.
- **It's inflexible** — no partial updates, no scripting, no diffing.

## What we know (headline findings)

All reverse-engineered from AM Master 1.3.7 (decompiled locally; the decompiled
sources are **not** redistributed here — see *Legal*):

- **Transport is USB CDC serial (pyserial) @ 9600 baud.** HID is detection-only.
- **No encryption on the config path** — the AES in the app is just PyInstaller
  bytecode obfuscation.
- **Frames are a fixed 64 bytes:** `[0]` category, `[1]` subcommand,
  `[2..62]` payload, `[63]` **CRC-8** (poly `0x07`).
- **LED model:** `frames` = the 40×5 = 200-px top display; `keyframes` = the
  90 per-key backlights. Slots 1/2/3 = pages 5/6/7. *(Empirically verified:
  active pages always pack to exactly 200 px / 90 px — see `verify_encoding.py`
  in the [research wiki](https://github.com/GeneralD/cyberboard-cli/wiki).)*
- **Send sequence and full command table** are documented in
  [`.claude/rules/30-write-protocol.md`](.claude/rules/30-write-protocol.md).

## Repository layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| [`.claude/rules/`](.claude/rules/) | The protocol & schema knowledge base (Japanese) — start at `00-overview.md` |
| `.claude/rules/30-write-protocol.md` | The definitive write-protocol spec (transport, frames, CRC, command table, send order) |
| [Research wiki](https://github.com/GeneralD/cyberboard-cli/wiki) | Raw reverse-engineering scripts (`verify_encoding.py`, `zscan.py`) and protocol experiments, moved out of the repo tree |

> Confidence is marked throughout: 🟢 source-confirmed · 🟡 strong inference ·
> 🔴 needs live-hardware capture.

## Roadmap

Done:

- **M0 — Protocol analysis** ✅ decompiled; encoding verified; wire bytes
  confirmed by live serial handshake on a real R4.
- **M1 — Full write** ✅ a known-good config writes over the reverse-engineered
  sequence (LED visually confirmed on hardware).
- **M2 — Read-back + diff** ✅ for the keymap (write → read → 1400/1400 match).
  LED has no read-back path, so it's authored from source.
- **M3 — Keymap build** ✅ `keymap.toml` → IR with lossless round-trip.
- **M5 — LED display authoring** ✅ GIF ⇄ IR codec + declarative animation recipes
  - an in-terminal player (`led play`, half-block truecolor) and a frame
    montage (`anim montage`) for judging motion/loop in a still viewer.

Productization ✅ a unified `cyberboard` CLI core, standalone packaging
(published to PyPI + a Homebrew tap), an MCP server (`cyberboard-mcp`), and a
Claude Code plugin — all calling the same core. Next: per-key LED authoring and
a sprite/vision LED design loop.

> Note: partial writes are **not** supported by firmware (`JSON_START` erases the
> whole config), so "swap just the LED" is done by read → merge → full write, not
> by a partial write.

## Legal

This is an independent interoperability project. The reverse-engineering was done
on a locally-owned copy of AM Master for the sole purpose of interoperating with
hardware the author owns. **The vendor's app, its installer, its extracted
bytecode, and the decompiled sources are deliberately excluded from this repo**
(see `.gitignore`); only original analysis and first-party tooling are published.
