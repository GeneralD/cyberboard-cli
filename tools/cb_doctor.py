"""Health check for the CyberBoard connection — `doctor` / preflight.

AM Master's worst failure mode is silence: you can't tell whether the board is
connected, held by another app, on the wrong port, or just dead. This runs the
exact checks that map to AM Master's known flakiness causes (see
.claude/rules/30-write-protocol.md §6) and reports a clear verdict — WITHOUT
writing anything. Every probe here is read-only ([1,1], [1,2], [2,6], [6,9]);
no JSON_START, no reset, no config change.

A clean run (device identified, port opens exclusively, CRC valid both ways,
and a full 94-frame keymap read-back streams back intact) is strong evidence
the write path is healthy — it exercises sustained multi-frame transfer, which
is what a config write needs.

Usage: cb_doctor.py [PORT]    # omit PORT to auto-scan
