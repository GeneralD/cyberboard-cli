"""dump — pull the device's current config into one provenance-labelled IR file.

The two halves of a CyberBoard config have asymmetric readability (see
cb_store): the keymap can be read straight off the device ([6,9] get_key_msg),
but the LED display / per-key frames cannot be read back at all — the only
record of them is the last full IR we wrote, kept locally in the store. So a
faithful dump is a *hybrid*: a live keymap stitched onto the stored LED state,
with each half labelled by where it came from so the result is never mistaken
for a clean live readout.

Provenance is emitted both as a `_provenance` block inside the IR (so the file
is self-describing) and as a one-line summary on stderr:

    keymap : live | stored@<ts> | unknown
    led    : last-written@<ts> | unknown

When the device is offline the keymap falls back to the stored copy (clearly
labelled `stored@<ts>`); with neither a device nor a stored config there is
nothing to dump and the command fails cleanly.

Usage:
    cb_dump.py [PORT] [-o FILE]      # -o omitted => stdout
